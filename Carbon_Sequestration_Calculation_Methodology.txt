Carbon Sequestration Calculation Methodology
Introduction
Carbon sequestration in forests refers to the process by which forests absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and store it in biomass (trees, shrubs), soil, and other organic matter. Understanding and quantifying carbon sequestration is crucial for assessing the role of forests in mitigating climate change and informing forest management practices.

This document outlines a basic methodology for calculating carbon sequestration in forests, including key concepts and steps involved in the process.

Key Concepts
Biomass Carbon
Biomass carbon refers to the amount of carbon stored in living plant biomass, including trees, shrubs, and understory vegetation.
It is typically quantified based on the biomass of different forest components, such as aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and litter.
Soil Organic Carbon
Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents the carbon stored in the soil in the form of organic matter, such as decomposed plant material, roots, and microorganisms.
SOC is influenced by factors such as soil type, climate, vegetation cover, and land management practices.
Carbon Sequestration Rate
Carbon sequestration rate refers to the rate at which forests remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it as carbon in biomass and soil over a specific time period.
It is commonly expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per hectare per year (tCO2e/ha/yr).
Methodology
1. Inventory Data Collection
Gather inventory data on forest characteristics, including tree species composition, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and forest area.
Collect soil data, such as soil type, depth, and organic matter content.
2. Biomass Estimation
Estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) using allometric equations based on tree measurements (DBH, height) and species-specific biomass factors.
Calculate belowground biomass (BGB) using empirical models or default values based on AGB.
Determine biomass carbon content using carbon concentration factors for different forest components.
3. Soil Carbon Estimation
Estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) using soil sampling and laboratory analysis or soil carbon models.
Quantify SOC stock based on soil bulk density, depth, and organic carbon content.
4. Total Carbon Sequestration Calculation
Sum the carbon stored in biomass and soil to calculate the total carbon stock per hectare.
Calculate the change in carbon stock over time to derive the carbon sequestration rate.
Conclusion
Accurately quantifying carbon sequestration in forests is essential for assessing their contribution to climate change mitigation efforts. By following the methodology outlined in this document, stakeholders can estimate carbon stocks and sequestration rates in forest ecosystems, informing sustainable forest management practices and climate policy decisions.
